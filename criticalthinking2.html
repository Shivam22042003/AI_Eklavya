                        <p>
                            Everyone thinks; it is our nature to do so. But much of our thinking, left to itself, is
                            biased,
                            distorted,
                            partial, uninformed or down-right prejudiced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet the quality of our life and that of what we produce, make,
                            or build depends precisely on the quality of our thought. Shoddy thinking is costly, both in
                            money and in
                            quality of life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Excellence in thought, however, must be systematically cultivated.

        <h1 class="heading">How To Improve Your Critical Thinking Skills</h1>
        <p>Be it in a personal or a professional context, you can never deny the significance and the necessity of good
            decision making.</p>
        <br>

        <div class="header_below_inside">
            <h4>1)Know exactly what you want </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowing exactly what you want is the first step of critical thinking.</li>
                <li>We have to think critically to solve problems so that they meets their objectives. Every decision we
                    make has an objective or purpose attached to it and identifying exactly what that is, what we
                    actually
                    want out of it, gives us a starting point to work with.</li>
                <li>So ask yourself: What do I want? What do I expect to get out of this? Until you know the answer to
                    these
                    questions you're not going to know what the right decision is.</li>
                <!-- <li></li> -->
            </ul>
            <h4>2)Deal with your biases</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We often think from only our own perspective to deal with problems. However, it helps with critical
                    thinking and decision making if you try thinking from someone else's point of view.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, it gives you a clearer picture of the overall situation. Let's say you're looking to
                    solve
                    a problem at work. Think of how your best friend might approach it, or how your partner or a sibling
                    might. Now think of how your boss might approach it.</li>
                <li>By allowing yourself to consider different perspectives you might find yourself hitting upon
                    solutions
                    you hadn't previously considered. </li>
                <!-- <li></li> -->
            </ul>
            <h4>3)Consider the consequences of your options</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Every option we choose has consequences for ourselves, or maybe others involved in the problem.</li>
                <li>You need to weigh up the possible consequences which may arise from each of your options and go for
                    the
                    one that benefits you most whilst limiting the negative effects on others involved.</li>
                <li>A good way to do this is by writing a list of pros and cons. By asking yourself to think of every
                    possible positive outcome alongside every possible negative outcome, you can make a much more
                    informed
                    decison. </li>
                <!-- <li></li> -->
            </ul>
            <h4>4)Do your research</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm sure you've heard that knowledge is power. However, many of us tend to rely a lot on what we
                    already
                    know and are reluctant to let go of our own beliefs.</li>
                <li>Critical thinking requires you to let go of your beliefs sometimes to solve problems. Reluctance to
                    learn, research or acquire new beliefs will only hold you back and certainly won't help you with
                    critical thinking.</li>
                <li>By taking time to do your research and focus on learning you'll find that over time you will evolve
                    and
                    adapt to overcome new situations and improve your critical thinking.</li>
                <!-- <li></li> -->
            </ul>
            <h4>5)Accept the fact that youâ€™re not always right </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>It's okay to make mistakes and no matter who we are, we all make them.</li>
                <li>However, most of us don't accept this fact which holds us back from thinking critically. If you are
                    doing something wrong and repeatedly keep doing it because you have already assumed that you can
                    never
                    go wrong, then this needs to change for your own good.</li>
                <li>Always double check solutions to problems, consider new options and view your mistakes as an
                    opportunity
                    to learn.</li>
                <!-- <li></li> -->
            </ul>
            <h4>6)Break it down </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Being able to see the big picture is great but it's even better if you can break things down into
                    smaller sections.</li>
                <li>The reason being that smaller sections are easier to mentally digest and work with.</li>
                <li>Working with numerous small things is an easier task than trying to solve the bigger picture which
                    can
                    become too much to handle.</li>
                <!-- <li></li> -->
            </ul>
            <h4>7)Don't overcomplicate things</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Overcomplicating things is something a lot of us have in common. It's a necessity to think things
                    through but it only makes things difficult if you begin overthinking. You have to discover the fine
                    line
                    between positive thinking and overthinking.</li>
                <li>There are a number of occasions where simplicity gets the job done.</li>
                <!-- <li></li> -->
